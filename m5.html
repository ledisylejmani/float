            BMW M5 CS shoots to the top of its class. Now producing 627 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque, the 4.4L twin-turbo V8 directs its power via an eight-speed automatic transmission to BMW's M xDrive all-wheel-drive system. With launch control, it'll rip its way from 0-60 mph in just 2.9 seconds, 0.2 seconds quicker than the M5 Competition. The standard M Driver's Package raises the top speed to 190 mph. Wisely, this package includes a voucher for the owner to take advantage of some driver training from a professional.

        <h1>Engine and Transmission</h1>
        <p>
            Like the regular M5, the M5 CS makes use of a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 but in this application, it makes 627 hp and 553 lb-ft of torque. By comparison, the normal M5 generates 600 hp and the M5 Competition has 617 hp. All three models have the same torque output, but the M5 CS's torque band is 90 rpm wider than that of the M5 Competition. In the CS, the familiar wave of torque from low down means that you don't need to floor it to make incredibly rapid progress, yet it has a 7,200 rpm redline so if space allows, you can extend the V8 if you wish. To ensure it can stand up to the rigors of track use, there is liquid-to-air intercooling for both turbos and an oil system with dual pumps.

The mighty V8 is paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and, using the Drivelogic switch, drivers can choose between various modes, including Efficient, Sport, or Track. The latter is best for track environments with its lightning-quick shifts, while in other modes, the transmission remains smooth. Although the M5's V8 has never sounded quite as brawny as Merc's AMG unit, it has a more aggressive snarl in the CS thanks to a dual-branch, electric flap-controlled sport exhaust system. Less sound deadening than in the normal M5 also doesn't hurt but by using the M Sound button, you can control how loud you want it to be.

It goes without saying that the M5 CS is a viciously fast sedan. Mid-range response is exceptional, so passing slower traffic in the city or at highway speeds is shockingly easy. Applying full throttle in this car will require more space and less traffic than the average road provides, such is the rate at which you cover ground.

The 10bhp increase is neither here nor there for an engine that already produces 616bhp, but the resulting 626bhp makes the M5 CS the most powerful M5 ever, and even with the accompanying 553lb ft unchanged from the M5 Comp, getting down a road quickly isn’t an issue – it shaves three-tenths from the M5 Comp’s 0-62mph time, reducing it to 3sec dead before it tops out at 189mph. But the CS can’t be defined by its numbers. There’s so much more to it than that.
